    <p class="text"><span class="Claude">Claude Monet</span> was a key figure in the Impressionist movement that transformed French painting in the second half of
    the nineteenth century. Throughout his long career, Monet consistently depicted the landscape and leisure activities
    of Paris and its environs as well as the Normandy coast. He led the way to twentieth-century modernism by developing
    a unique style that strove to capture on canvas the very act of perceiving nature.</p>
<p class="text">Raised in Normandy, Monet was introduced to plein-air painting by Eugène Boudin (2003.20.2), known for paintings of
    the resorts that dotted the region’s Channel coast, and subsequently studied informally with the Dutch landscapist
    Johan Jongkind (1819–1891). When he was twenty-two, Monet joined the Paris studio of the academic history painter
    Charles Gleyre. His classmates included Auguste Renoir, Frédéric Bazille, and other future Impressionists. Monet
    enjoyed limited success in these early years, with a handful of landscapes, seascapes, and portraits accepted for
    exhibition at the annual Salons of the 1860s. Yet rejection of many of his more ambitious works, notably the
    large-scale Women in the Garden (1866; Musée d’Orsay, Paris), inspired Monet to join with Edgar Degas, Édouard
    Manet, Camille Pissarro, Renoir, and others in establishing an independent exhibition in 1874. Impression, Sunrise
    (1873; Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris), one of Monet’s contributions to this exhibition, drew particular scorn for the
    unfinished appearance of its loose handling and indistinct forms. Yet the artists saw the criticism as a badge of
    honor, and subsequently called themselves “Impressionists” after the painting’s title, even though the name was
    first used derisively.</p>
<p class="text">Monet found subjects in his immediate surroundings, as he painted the people and places he knew best. His first wife,
    Camille (2002.62.1), and his second wife, Alice, frequently served as models. His landscapes chart journeys around
    the north of France (31.67.11) and to London, where he escaped the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. Returning to
    France, Monet moved first to Argenteuil, just fifteen minutes from Paris by train, then west to Vétheuil, Poissy,
    and finally to the more rural Giverny in 1883. His homes and gardens became gathering places for friends, including
    Manet and Renoir, who often painted alongside their host (1976.201.14). Yet Monet’s paintings cast a surprisingly
    objective eye on these scenes, which include few signs of domestic relations.</p>
<p class="text">Following in the path of the Barbizon painters, who had set up their easels in the Fontainebleau Forest (64.210)
    earlier in the century, Monet adopted and extended their commitment to close observation and naturalistic
    representation. Whereas the Barbizon artists painted only preliminary sketches en plein air, Monet often worked
    directly on large-scale canvases out of doors, then reworked and completed them in his studio. His quest to capture
    nature more accurately also prompted him to reject European conventions governing composition, color, and
    perspective. Influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, Monet’s asymmetrical arrangements of forms emphasized their
    two-dimensional surfaces by eliminating linear perspective and abandoning three-dimensional modeling. He brought a
    vibrant brightness to his works by using unmediated colors, adding a range of tones to his shadows, and preparing
    canvases with light-colored primers instead of the dark grounds used in traditional landscape paintings.</p>
<p class="text">Monet’s interest in recording perceptual processes reached its apogee in his series paintings (e.g., Haystacks
    [1891], Poplars [1892], Rouen Cathedral [1894]) that dominate his output in the 1890s. In each series, Monet painted
    the same site again and again, recording how its appearance changed with the time of day. Light and shadow seem as
    substantial as stone in his Rouen Cathedral (30.95.250) series. Monet reports that he rented a room across from the
    cathedral’s western facade in 1892 and 1893, where he kept multiple canvases in process and moved from one to the
    next as the light shifted. In 1894, he reworked the canvases to their finished states.</p>
<p class="text">In the 1910s and 1920s, Monet focused almost exclusively on the picturesque water-lily pond (1983.532) that he
    created on his property at Giverny. His final series depicts the pond in a set of mural-sized canvases where
    abstract renderings of plant and water emerge from broad strokes of color and intricately built-up textures. Shortly
    after Monet died (a wealthy and well-respected man at the age of eighty-six), the French government installed his
    last water-lily series in specially constructed galleries at the Orangerie in Paris, where they remain today.</p>
